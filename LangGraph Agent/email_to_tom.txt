Dear Tom, I regret to inform you that I won't be able to attend the meeting scheduled for today. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding in this matter. If there's anything I can do to catch up on what I miss, please let me know. However, I am available to meet tomorrow at 1:00 PM at NYC if that works for you.

Best regards,
Aditya
